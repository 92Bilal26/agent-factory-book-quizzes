# Why Markdown Matters for AI Communication?

Imagine you want to build a mobile app. You write a long email to an AI agent:

> "Hey, I need an app for tracking tasks. Users should be able to add tasks and see them and delete them. When they open the app there should be a menu. The menu should let them pick what to do. It should have options for adding, viewing, and deleting. Also it should save tasks so they don't lose them when they close the app."

This describes what you want, but it's messy. The AI has to guess:

-   What are the main features?
-   What should the menu look like?
-   What order should things appear in?

Now imagine you organize that same request with clear structure:

> **Task Tracker App**
> 
> **Features:**
> 
> -   Add new tasks
> -   View all tasks
> -   Delete tasks
> -   Save tasks between sessions
> 
> **Menu Options:**
> 
> 1.  Add Task
> 2.  View Tasks
> 3.  Delete Task
> 4.  Exit

Same information, but now the AI can instantly see:

-   Four distinct features
-   Four menu options in a specific order
-   What the app does and how users interact with it

That structured format is **markdown** — and it's the difference between confused AI and accurate code generation.

* * *

## What Is Markdown?

Markdown is **structured text** that humans can read easily but computers can also parse perfectly.

Think of it like organizing files:

-   **Messy**: Documents scattered randomly in a drawer
-   **Structured**: Documents in labeled folders

A person can find things either way, but a robot needs clear labels. Markdown adds those labels to text so both humans AND AI agents understand it.

### Why Use Markdown Everywhere

According to GitHub's documentation, almost every software project has a README file explaining what the project does. These README files use markdown because:

1.  **Developers can read it** — No special software needed, just plain text
2.  **AI can parse it** — The structure tells AI what each section means
3.  **It renders beautifully** — GitHub, documentation sites, and AI tools display it formatted
4.  **It's stable** — Created in 2004 by John Gruber, with [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) providing a formal specification starting in 2014

Markdown Flavors

You'll encounter different "flavors" of markdown. **CommonMark** is the base standard. **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)** extends it with tables, task lists (`- [ ]`), and strikethrough (`~~text~~`). Most tools you'll use support GFM, so these extensions work almost everywhere.

When you write in markdown, you're using the same format that millions of developers use to communicate with both humans and AI.

## Concept 1: Structured Text vs. Unstructured Text

Let's compare two ways to describe the same project:

### Version 1: Unstructured (Plain Text)

```
I want a weather app. It should show current temperature and conditions.Users enter a city name. The app calls an API to get data. It shoulddisplay temperature in Fahrenheit. Also show humidity and wind speed.Make sure to handle errors if the city doesn't exist.
```

An AI reading this has to **guess**:

-   How many features are there? (Temperature, conditions, humidity, wind — is that 4 features or 1?)
-   What's required vs optional?
-   What order should things appear?

### Version 2: Structured (Markdown)

```
Weather AppFeatures:- Display current temperature (Fahrenheit)- Show current weather conditions- Display humidity percentage- Display wind speedUser Flow:1. User enters city name2. App calls weather API3. App displays weather data4. If city not found, show error message
```

Now the AI **knows**:

-   Exactly 4 features (each on its own line)
-   The sequence of steps (numbered 1-4)
-   Error handling is part of the flow

The structure removes ambiguity. You're not teaching the AI to guess — you're giving it clear labels.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> **Explore with your AI**: "I just learned that structured text helps AI understand requirements better. Can you show me two versions of a simple project description—one unstructured paragraph and one using markdown structure? Use a coffee shop ordering app as the example. Then explain which version would be clearer for you to implement."

Expert Insight

Notice how structure isn't just about making text look nice. When you add markdown headings and lists, you're creating **semantic meaning** that AI can parse. This is why markdown is called "structured text"—the structure itself communicates intent. In professional development, clear structure reduces implementation errors and speeds up development cycles.

Pro-Tip: Why Structure Helps AI at the Technical Level

Large Language Models (LLMs) process text as "tokens" — small chunks of words or characters. When you write structured markdown, you're giving the AI clearer token boundaries and "attention cues." A heading like `## Features` tells the model: "Everything below this relates to features." Lists create natural separations between items. This structure helps the AI's attention mechanism focus on relevant sections rather than treating your entire document as one continuous stream. Better structure = better AI comprehension.

* * *

## Concept 2: Markdown as the "Intent Layer" in AIDD

AI-Driven Development (AIDD) has three layers. Markdown is how you work in the first layer:

### Layer 1: Intent Layer (YOU write here)

You write **what you want** in a specification using markdown. Your spec describes:

-   What problem you're solving
-   What the software should do
-   How to know if it's working

**Your responsibility**: Make your intent clear.

**Why markdown stays in Layer 1**: The specification represents **your intent** — the authoritative definition of what should be built. Even when AI helps draft or refine the spec, you have final approval authority. The implementation (Layer 3) must match the specification, not the other way around. This keeps you in control: change the spec, and the AI rebuilds to match.

### Layer 2: Reasoning Layer (AI works here)

The AI reads your markdown specification and figures out:

-   What code structure is needed
-   What libraries to use
-   How to implement each feature

**AI's responsibility**: Translate your intent into a plan.

### Layer 3: Implementation Layer (AI generates here)

The AI writes actual code that matches your specification.

![Workflow diagram showing three stages: Human Intent (top, what you want to build), Markdown Specification (middle, structured document expressing your intent), and AI Execution (bottom, AI reads spec and generates code). Arrows flow downward showing how human ideas become structured specs that AI can implement.](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-3/chapter-10/markdown-intent-layer.png)

**AI's responsibility**: Execute the plan and generate working code.

### Why Markdown Matters for This Workflow

Your markdown specification is the **bridge** between what you want (Layer 1) and what gets built (Layer 3). If your spec is clear and structured, the AI can generate accurate code. If it's vague and messy, the AI has to guess.

**Example:**

You write this specification in markdown (Layer 1):

```
Task Reminder AppFeatures:- Create reminder with title and due date- View list of all reminders- Mark reminder as complete- Delete old remindersExpected Behavior:When user views reminders, show them sorted by due date withupcoming reminders first.
```

The AI reads this (Layer 2), plans the implementation, and generates Python code (Layer 3) that does exactly what you specified.

**The key**: Because your specification used structure (lists for features, clear sections), the AI didn't have to guess what "reminders" means or how they should be sorted.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "I want to test how structure affects code generation. First, implement this unstructured request: 'Make an app that converts temperatures.' Now implement this structured version:
> 
> Temperature Converter
> 
> Features:
> 
> -   Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
> -   Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
> -   Display formula used
> 
> Expected Output: Enter temperature: 32F Result: 0°C (Formula: (32-32) × 5/9)
> 
> Compare the two results. Which specification led to more accurate code? What did the structured version communicate that the unstructured one didn't?"

* * *

## Real-World Context: Where You'll Use Markdown

You'll use markdown in these real AIDD scenarios:

### 1\. GitHub README Files

When you create a project, you write a README explaining:

-   What the project does
-   How to install it
-   How to use it
-   How to contribute

GitHub renders your markdown as a formatted webpage.

### 2\. Specifications for AI Agents

When you want an AI to build something, you write a spec describing:

-   The problem you're solving
-   Features you need
-   Expected output
-   Acceptance criteria

The AI parses your markdown to understand what to build.

### 3\. Documentation Sites

When you build software, you create documentation explaining how it works. Documentation sites like Docusaurus (what this book uses) take markdown and create searchable, navigable websites.

### 4\. AI Chat Prompts

When you ask ChatGPT or Claude to generate code, you can format your request with markdown structure to get better results. Instead of a paragraph, you give the AI a structured specification.

**In all these cases**, markdown is the format that bridges human intent and machine action.

Expert Insight

Here's what makes markdown powerful in AI-native development: it's both human-readable and machine-parseable. You don't need special software to read it (unlike Word docs), yet it has enough structure for AI to extract meaning. This dual nature makes it the universal format for specifications, documentation, and AI communication. Professional development teams use markdown for everything from project READMEs to architecture decision records (ADRs).

* * *

## Understanding This Chapter's Approach

This chapter teaches markdown differently than other tutorials. Most tutorials teach you markdown syntax just for formatting text. This chapter teaches you markdown as a **specification language** for working with AI.

### Learning Path

**Lessons 2-4 (Core Syntax)**: You'll learn the essential markdown elements for writing specifications:

-   **Lesson 2**: Headings — creating document hierarchy
-   **Lesson 3**: Lists — organizing features and steps
-   **Lesson 4**: Code blocks — showing examples and expected output

**Lesson 5 (Integration)**: You'll combine everything into your **first complete specification**:

-   Add links to documentation and images for diagrams
-   Write a full spec using headings, lists, and code blocks
-   Validate your spec with AI feedback

By the end, you won't just know markdown syntax — you'll understand how to use markdown as the Intent Layer that makes AI-driven development possible.

## How to Verify AI Responses (Critical Skill)

You'll use AI throughout this chapter to check your work and get feedback. But here's the most important lesson: **AI agents make mistakes**. Your job isn't just to ask AI questions—it's to **verify the AI's answers are correct**.

### The Verification Framework

When AI reviews your markdown or answers your questions, use this 4-step verification process:

**1\. Check Against What You Know**

-   Compare AI's feedback to the rules you learned in this lesson
-   Example: If AI says your heading hierarchy is correct, manually check: Did you skip any levels?

**2\. Ask AI to Explain Its Reasoning**

-   Don't just accept "Yes, that's correct"
-   Ask: "Why is this correct? Explain your reasoning."
-   This forces AI to show its work (like showing work in math class)

**3\. Test Specific Claims**

-   If AI says "This markdown will render correctly," try rendering it yourself
-   If AI says "This is valid syntax," check against a markdown reference

**4\. Cross-Reference When Unsure**

-   Check official documentation ([CommonMark spec](https://commonmark.org/))
-   Ask a different AI tool if you get conflicting answers
-   Search for examples in real GitHub repositories

### Example: Verifying AI Feedback

**You ask ChatGPT**: "Is this specification clear?"

**ChatGPT responds**: "Yes, your specification is very clear!"

**❌ Don't do this**: Accept it and move on

**✅ Do this instead**:

1.  **Check against the lesson**: Does my spec have headings, lists, and code blocks? (Required elements from this chapter)
2.  **Ask for reasoning**: "What makes it clear? Which parts are strongest?"
3.  **Test it**: Ask AI to implement the spec. If the generated code doesn't match what you wanted, your spec wasn't clear.
4.  **Compare**: Show your spec to a classmate or different AI. Do they understand it the same way?

### Why This Matters

**AI is a thinking partner, not an authority.** When you verify AI responses, you're:

-   Building your own judgment (not blindly trusting AI)
-   Catching AI mistakes before they become your mistakes
-   Learning what "good" looks like (by comparing AI feedback to reality)

This verification skill is **as important as learning markdown itself**. You'll use it in every "Try With AI" exercise in this chapter.

* * *

## Try With AI

Now that you understand WHY markdown matters and HOW to verify AI responses, let's explore these concepts with AI.

### Setup

Use ChatGPT web (if you haven't set up an AI tool from earlier chapters yet). If you have Claude Code or another AI companion installed, feel free to use that instead.

### Prompt Set

**Prompt 1 (Concept Exploration):**

Copy and paste this into ChatGPT:

```
I'm learning about markdown as a specification language for AI-drivendevelopment. Can you explain the difference between these two projectdescriptions:Version 1: "I want a calculator app with addition, subtraction,multiplication, and division. It should work in the terminal."Version 2:Calculator AppFeatures:- Addition- Subtraction- Multiplication- DivisionInterface: Command-line terminalWhich one is clearer for you to work with, and why?
```

**Expected Outcome:**

ChatGPT will explain that Version 2 is clearer because:

-   Features are listed separately (easier to parse)
-   Interface is explicitly stated
-   Structure removes ambiguity

* * *

**Prompt 2 (Real-World Connection):**

Ask ChatGPT:

```
Why do most GitHub repositories use README.md files written in markdowninstead of plain .txt files or Word documents?
```

**Expected Outcome:**

ChatGPT will explain that markdown:

-   Renders nicely on GitHub (formatted webpage)
-   Is readable as plain text (no special software needed)
-   Is version-control friendly (git can track changes line-by-line)
-   Is the standard developers expect

* * *

**Prompt 3 (Apply to Your Domain):**

Now try writing your own structured description. Think of a simple app or tool you'd like to build, then ask:

```
I want to practice writing structured specifications. Here's my project idea:[Your App Name]Problem: [One sentence describing what problem it solves]Features:- [Feature 1]- [Feature 2]- [Feature 3]Can you review this specification and tell me:1. Is the structure clear enough for you to understand what to build?2. What additional sections would make this specification more complete?3. Can you show me an improved version with your suggestions?
```

**Expected Outcome:**

ChatGPT will review your specification and suggest improvements like:

-   Adding acceptance criteria (how to know if it works)
-   Clarifying user flow (step-by-step interaction)
-   Specifying constraints (what it should NOT do)

-   Headings - Creating Document Hierarchy

Updated Feb 12, 2026

[Version history](https://github.com/panaversity/ai-native-software-development/commits/main/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/02-markdown-writing-instructions/02-headings.md)

# Headings - Creating Document Hierarchy

Imagine trying to find information in a document that's just one long wall of text. You'd scroll endlessly, hunting for the part you need. Now imagine that same document with clear sections: "Problem," "Solution," "Features," "Installation." Suddenly you can scan it in seconds.

In markdown, headings create this structure. They organize your document into sections that both humans and AI agents can quickly understand. When you write a specification, headings tell the AI: "This is the problem. These are the features. This is what the output should look like."

This lesson teaches you how to create clear document structure using headings.

* * *

## Concept 1: Using Hash Symbols for Headings

Markdown uses the **hash symbol** (`#`) to create headings. More hash symbols = smaller heading.

Here's how it works:

```
# Level 1 Heading (Largest)## Level 2 Heading (Large)### Level 3 Heading (Medium)#### Level 4 Heading (Small)##### Level 5 Heading (Smaller)###### Level 6 Heading (Smallest)
```

**What each level is for:**

-   **Level 1 (`#`)**: The document title (use once at the top)
-   **Level 2 (`##`)**: Main sections (Problem, Features, Installation, etc.)
-   **Level 3 (`###`)**: Subsections within a main section
-   **Level 4 (`####`)**: Deep technical details like constraints, edge cases, or exceptions within a subsection
-   **Level 5-6 (`#####`, `######`)**: Deep nesting (avoid in specifications — if you need these, your document structure is probably too complex)

### Example: A Simple Specification

Here's a specification for a task list app:

```
# Task List App## ProblemUsers need a simple way to track daily tasks without complicated software.## Features- Add new tasks- View all tasks- Mark tasks as complete- Delete old tasks## Expected OutputWhen user views tasks, they should see:1. Buy groceries [Complete]2. Call dentist [Pending]3. Submit report [Pending]## InstallationRun this command to install:pip install task-tracker
```

**See the structure?**

-   One Level 1 heading for the title: `# Task List App`
-   Four Level 2 headings for main sections: `## Problem`, `## Features`, etc.
-   No Level 3 headings needed (the document is simple enough)

This structure lets anyone (human or AI) scan the document and immediately understand what each section contains.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> **Explore with your AI**: "I'm learning about markdown heading hierarchy. Can you explain why skipping heading levels (like going from # directly to ###) creates problems for AI agents parsing specifications? Use an analogy from organizing physical files or folders to help me understand."

> **Bonus prompt**: "Show me how you see this document structure as a JSON tree — I want to visualize how you parse the headings."

* * *

## Concept 2: Following Proper Hierarchy

Headings must follow a logical **hierarchy** — you can't skip levels.

Think of headings like organizing folders on your computer:

```
Main Folder (Level 1)  ├── Documents Folder (Level 2)  │   ├── Work Documents (Level 3)  │   └── Personal Documents (Level 3)  └── Photos Folder (Level 2)      ├── Vacation Photos (Level 3)      └── Family Photos (Level 3)
```

You go from broad to specific. You don't put "Vacation Photos" directly under "Main Folder" — it belongs under "Photos Folder" first.

### Correct Hierarchy Example

```
# Project Documentation## Installation GuideInstructions for setting up the project.### Step 1: Install DependenciesRun npm install to get started.### Step 2: Configure SettingsEdit the config.json file.## User GuideHow to use the application.
```

**This is correct because:**

-   Level 1 (`#`) is the overall title
-   Level 2 (`##`) sections divide the document
-   Level 3 (`###`) subsections provide details under each Level 2 section

### Wrong Hierarchy Example (Don't Do This)

```
# Project Documentation### Step 1: Install Dependencies  ← WRONG! Skipped Level 2This doesn't make sense without a parent section.## Installation Guide  ← Now Level 2 appears after Level 3
```

**This is wrong because:**

-   We jumped from Level 1 directly to Level 3 (skipped Level 2)
-   The hierarchy is broken — readers don't know what "Step 1" belongs to
-   Even if it renders visually, it breaks the AI's logical map of your document (and hurts accessibility for screen readers)

**The fix:** Always include Level 2 before Level 3:

```
# Project Documentation## Installation Guide### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```

Expert Insight

Proper heading hierarchy isn't just a style preference—it's essential for accessibility and machine parsing. Screen readers use heading levels to help visually impaired users navigate documents. AI agents use the hierarchy to understand document structure and relationships between sections. When you skip levels, both humans using assistive technology and AI parsing tools lose critical structural information. This is why professional documentation standards enforce strict heading hierarchy.

* * *

## Practice Exercise: Task Tracker App (Part 1 - Headings)

**Important**: You'll build this **same Task Tracker App specification** across Lessons 2-5. Each lesson adds a new markdown element:

-   **Lesson 2 (now)**: Add headings to create structure
-   **Lesson 3**: Add lists to organize features and steps
-   **Lesson 4**: Add code blocks to show expected output
-   **Lesson 5**: Add links, images, and emphasis to complete it

By Lesson 5, you'll have a complete specification that an AI agent can implement.

### Your Task for Lesson 2

Create the **structure** for a Task Tracker App specification using only headings.

**Requirements:**

-   Add a Level 1 title: `# Task Tracker App`
-   Include these Level 2 sections: `## Problem`, `## Features`, `## Expected Output`, `## Installation` (Note: `## Context` or `## User Story` are also common alternatives to `## Problem`)
-   Under Features, add Level 3 headings: `### Add Tasks`, `### View Tasks`, `### Mark Complete`, `### Delete Tasks`

**Template to fill in:**

```
# Task Tracker App## Problem[In Lesson 3, you'll add a description here]## Features### Add Tasks[Features will be described in Lesson 3]### View Tasks[Features will be described in Lesson 3]### Mark Complete[Features will be described in Lesson 3]### Delete Tasks[Features will be described in Lesson 3]## Expected Output[In Lesson 4, you'll add a code block showing what the app prints]## Installation[In Lesson 3, you'll add installation steps here]
```

**For now**: Just create the heading structure. Leave the sections empty (we'll fill them in later lessons).

### Validation Checklist

After you write your specification structure, check these:

1.  Document has exactly ONE Level 1 heading (`# Task Tracker App`)
2.  Four Level 2 headings (`## Problem`, `## Features`, `## Expected Output`, `## Installation`)
3.  Four Level 3 headings under `## Features` (Add Tasks, View Tasks, Mark Complete, Delete Tasks)
4.  No levels are skipped (Level 3 headings only appear under Level 2)
5.  Each heading describes what its section will contain

**Save this file!** You'll continue building it in Lessons 3, 4, and 5.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Here's my Task Tracker App heading structure:
> 
> \[paste your structure\]
> 
> Check if my heading hierarchy is correct—did I skip any levels? Suggest whether any sections need subsections. Then tell me: is this structure clear enough for you to implement from, or would you need more information?"

* * *

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting the Space

**Wrong:**

```
#Heading Without Space
```

**Correct:**

```
# Heading With Space
```

Always put a space after the hash symbols.

### Mistake 2: Using Multiple Level 1 Headings

**Wrong:**

```
# My App# Problem# Features
```

**Correct:**

```
# My App## Problem## Features
```

Use `#` only once for the document title. Use `##` for main sections.

### Mistake 3: Skipping Levels

**Wrong:**

```
# My App### Installation Steps  ← Skipped Level 2
```

**Correct:**

```
# My App## Installation### Installation Steps
```

Always include the intermediate level.

* * *

## Why This Matters for AI

When you write a specification with clear headings, AI agents can:

1.  **Parse the structure** — "This document has 4 main sections"
2.  **Find specific information** — "The features are in the Features section"
3.  **Validate completeness** — "Does this spec include a Problem section?"
4.  **Generate better code** — "The features list tells me what functions to create"

Good headings make your specifications easier for AI to understand, which means better code generation.

Expert Insight

When AI agents parse your specification, headings serve as navigation landmarks. The AI can quickly locate "Features," "Installation," or "Expected Output" sections without reading every word. This speeds up processing and improves accuracy. In professional development, well-structured specifications reduce implementation time by 30-50% because both humans and AI can find information instantly.

* * *

## Try With AI

Now let's validate your Task Tracker App heading structure with AI feedback.

### Setup

Use ChatGPT web (or your AI companion if you've set one up from earlier chapters).

### Exercise

Take the **Task Tracker App specification structure** you created above and ask ChatGPT to review it with these prompts:

**Prompt 1 (Structure Check):**

```
I'm learning markdown headings. Can you check if this specificationhas correct heading hierarchy? Tell me if I skipped any levels orused the wrong heading sizes:[Paste your specification here]
```

**Prompt 2 (Clarity Check):**

```
Based on just my document headings (not the content), could youbuild this project? What questions would you have? What additionalsections might be missing?
```

**Prompt 3 (Organization Feedback):**

```
If you were implementing this specification, would this headingstructure help you understand the requirements clearly? Why or why not?
```

### Expected Outcomes

From **Prompt 1**, you should get:

-   Confirmation that your hierarchy is logical (no skipped levels)
-   Feedback on whether headings are descriptive
-   Suggestions for clarity if any headings are vague

From **Prompt 2**, you should see:

-   Which sections are clear from headings alone
-   What sections might be missing (e.g., "Installation" if you forgot it)
-   Questions that reveal gaps in your specification

From **Prompt 3**, you should understand:

-   Whether your structure is implementable
-   How the AI agent reads and interprets document structure
-   Confirmation that clear hierarchy = clearer AI-generated code

-   Lists - Organizing Ideas

Updated Feb 12, 2026

[Version history](https://github.com/panaversity/ai-native-software-development/commits/main/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/02-markdown-writing-instructions/03-lists.md)

# Lists - Organizing Ideas

Imagine you're giving someone installation instructions in paragraph form:

> "First install Python version 3.9 or higher, then download the project files, after that install the required packages using pip, and finally run the program."

Now imagine the same information as a numbered list:

> 1.  Install Python 3.9 or higher
> 2.  Download the project files
> 3.  Install required packages: `pip install requests`
> 4.  Run the program: `python app.py`

The second version is instantly clearer. You can see at a glance that there are 4 steps, in a specific order.

Lists are essential in specifications because they help you present information clearly. When an AI agent reads a specification with proper lists, it immediately understands: "These are distinct items" or "These steps must happen in order."

This lesson teaches you two types of lists and when to use each.

* * *

## Concept 1: Unordered Lists (Bullet Points)

Use **unordered lists** when you have items that don't need to be in any specific order. In markdown, create them with a dash (`-`) or asterisk (`*`) followed by a space.

### Basic Syntax

```
- First item- Second item- Third item
```

Or with asterisks or plus signs (same result):

```
* First item* Second item* Third item+ First item+ Second item+ Third item
```

**Tip**: Pick one style (`-`, `*`, or `+`) and stick with it throughout your document.

### Nested Lists

You can create sub-items by indenting with 2 spaces:

```
- Main feature  - Sub-feature A  - Sub-feature B- Another feature  - Sub-feature C
```

note

Some markdown parsers require a blank line before lists to render correctly. If your list isn't rendering, add a blank line above it.

### When to Use Unordered Lists

Use bullet points when:

-   Items have no specific sequence
-   Order doesn't matter for understanding
-   You're listing features, requirements, or options
-   Items are independent of each other

### Example: Feature List

Here's a feature list for a task tracker app:

```
# Task Tracker App## Features- Add tasks with title and description- View all tasks with completion status- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete- Delete tasks you no longer need- Save tasks to file (persist between sessions)
```

**Why bullet points work here**: Each feature is independent. Whether "Add tasks" comes before or after "Delete tasks" doesn't change what the app needs to do. The AI can implement these features in any order.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> **Explore with your AI**: "I'm learning when to use ordered vs unordered lists. Can you give me three examples of requirements that MUST be ordered lists (sequence matters) and three that should be unordered lists (sequence doesn't matter)? Use real software project examples."

* * *

## Concept 2: Ordered Lists (Numbered Steps)

Use **ordered lists** when items must be done in a specific sequence. In markdown, create them by typing `1.` followed by a space.

### Basic Syntax

```
1. First step2. Second step3. Third step
```

Markdown Numbering Behavior

Markdown auto-numbers based on the **first number** in the list. If you start with `11.`, the next items render as `12, 13, 14...` regardless of what you type:

```
11. This renders as 112. This renders as 12 (not 2!)3. This renders as 13
```

**For AI-native development**: Always use correct sequential numbers (`1. 2. 3.`) in your raw markdown. AI agents often read the source file directly, not the rendered HTML. Writing all `1.`s may confuse older models parsing your specification.

### When to Use Ordered Lists

Use numbered lists when:

-   Steps must be done in sequence
-   Order matters for correctness
-   You're showing installation steps, procedures, or workflows
-   Each step depends on the previous one

### Example: Installation Steps

Here's installation instructions for a weather app:

```
# Weather Dashboard## Installation1. Install Python 3.9 or higher from python.org2. Download the project files3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd weather-dashboard`4. Install required packages: `pip install requests`5. Run the program: `python weather.py`
```

**Why numbered steps work here**: You **must** install Python before you can install packages. You **must** navigate to the folder before running the program. The sequence matters.

### Example: Troubleshooting Steps

```
## Troubleshooting: "Module Not Found" ErrorIf you see this error, try these steps in order:1. Check that Python 3.9+ is installed: `python --version`2. Verify you're in the correct folder: `pwd` (Mac/Linux) or `cd` (Windows)3. Reinstall packages: `pip install --upgrade requests`4. If still failing, delete venv folder and recreate it
```

The sequence matters here too — you check Python first, then location, then reinstall, then venv.

Expert Insight

Notice how ordered lists communicate dependencies. In the installation example, step 2 depends on step 1 completing successfully. This dependency chain is critical for AI agents—they know they can't run the program before installing packages, and can't install packages before verifying Python exists. Clear sequencing prevents AI from generating incorrect workflows where steps run out of order.

* * *

## Concept 3: Choosing the Right List Type

How do you know which type to use? Ask yourself: **Does order matter?**

### Decision Guide

**Use unordered lists (`-`) when:**

-   Describing features of an app
-   Listing requirements or constraints
-   Showing options or alternatives
-   Items can be done in any order

**Use ordered lists (`1.`) when:**

-   Showing installation instructions
-   Describing a workflow or process
-   Giving troubleshooting steps
-   Sequence affects outcome

### Examples Side by Side

**Unordered (order doesn't matter):**

```
## Features- Dark mode support- Export to PDF- Auto-save every 5 minutes- Keyboard shortcuts
```

These features are independent. Adding dark mode doesn't require export to PDF first.

**Ordered (order matters):**

```
## Setup Process1. Create account2. Verify email address3. Set up profile4. Start using the app
```

You **must** create an account before verifying email. You **must** verify email before setting up profile.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "I'm writing a specification with these items:
> 
> 1.  App must run on Windows, Mac, and Linux
> 2.  App must support dark mode and light mode
> 3.  User must log in before accessing dashboard
> 4.  User must verify email before account activation
> 
> Which should be unordered lists (bullet points) and which should be ordered lists (numbered)? Explain your reasoning. Help me understand how to spot dependencies."

* * *

## Practice Exercise: Task Tracker App (Part 2 - Lists)

**Continuing from Lesson 2**: Open the Task Tracker App specification you created in Lesson 2. You'll now **add lists** to organize features and installation steps.

### Your Task for Lesson 3

Add two types of lists to your existing Task Tracker App structure:

**Part 1: Add Feature Descriptions (Unordered Lists)**

Under each Level 3 heading in the Features section, add bullet points describing what that feature does:

```
## Features### Add Tasks- Create tasks with title and description- Set optional due dates- Assign priority levels (high, medium, low)### View Tasks- Display all tasks with status- Filter by priority or due date- Show completed and pending separately### Mark Complete- Mark tasks as done- Track completion timestamps- Move completed tasks to archive### Delete Tasks- Remove tasks permanently- Confirm before deleting to prevent accidents
```

Pro-Tip: Nested Lists vs. More Headings

If a feature has sub-requirements, use **nested lists** instead of creating more Level 3 headings:

```
### Add Tasks- Create tasks with title and description  - Title is required (max 100 characters)  - Description is optional- Set optional due dates
```

**Rule of thumb**: Use headings for major sections, nested lists for details within a section. If you find yourself creating 10+ Level 3 headings, consider consolidating with nested lists.

**Part 2: Add Installation Steps (Ordered List)**

Fill in the Installation section with numbered steps:

```
## Installation1. Install Python 3.9 or higher from python.org2. Download the task tracker files from GitHub3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd task-tracker`4. Run the program: `python tracker.py`
```

**Part 3: Add Problem Description**

Under the Problem section, describe what problem this app solves (1-2 sentences as a paragraph, not a list).

### Validation Checklist

Check your updated specification:

1.  Feature descriptions use unordered lists (`-`) under each Level 3 heading
2.  Installation uses ordered list (`1. 2. 3. 4.`)
3.  Each list item starts with dash/number + space
4.  Feature lists have no specific order (could be rearranged)
5.  Installation steps must be done in sequence
6.  Problem section is a paragraph (not a list)

**Save this file!** You'll add code blocks in Lesson 4.

* * *

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting the Space

**Wrong:**

```
-No space after dash1.No space after number
```

**Correct:**

```
- Space after dash1. Space after number
```

Always put a space after the dash or number.

### Mistake 2: Using Ordered Lists for Features

**Wrong (features don't need order):**

```
## Features1. Dark mode2. Export to PDF3. Auto-save
```

**Correct:**

```
## Features- Dark mode- Export to PDF- Auto-save
```

Features usually don't have a required order.

### Mistake 3: Using Unordered Lists for Steps

**Wrong (steps need order):**

```
## Installation- Install Python- Run the program- Install packages
```

**Correct:**

```
## Installation1. Install Python2. Install packages3. Run the program
```

Installation steps must be in the right sequence.

* * *

## Why This Matters for AI

When you use lists correctly in specifications, AI agents can:

1.  **Identify distinct items** — "This app has 5 features"
2.  **Understand dependencies** — "Step 2 requires Step 1 to complete first"
3.  **Generate appropriate code** — "Create 5 functions, one for each feature"
4.  **Follow sequences** — "Set up installation script with these 4 steps in order"

Good list usage makes your specifications clearer, which leads to better AI-generated code.

Expert Insight

Professional specifications use list type as semantic information. When AI sees an unordered list under "Features," it knows these are parallel capabilities that can be developed independently—perfect for parallel development or modular architecture. When it sees ordered lists under "Installation," it knows to generate sequential scripts or documentation. This semantic clarity reduces miscommunication and speeds up development.

* * *

## Try With AI

Validate your Task Tracker App lists with AI feedback.

### Setup

Use ChatGPT web (or your AI companion from earlier chapters).

### Exercise

Take your **updated Task Tracker App specification** (now with lists added) and ask ChatGPT to review it:

**Prompt 1 (List Type Check):**

```
I'm learning markdown lists. Can you check if I used the right list types?Tell me if my features should be numbered or if my steps should be bullet points:[Paste your specification here]
```

**Prompt 2 (Clarity Check):**

```
Can you identify:1. How many features this app has2. How many installation steps are required3. Whether the steps must be done in orderBased on my lists?
```

**Prompt 3 (Improvement Suggestion):**

```
Based on my specification, what other lists could I add to makethis clearer? (Like requirements, error messages, or configuration steps)
```

### Expected Outcomes

From **Prompt 1**: ChatGPT will confirm whether you chose the right list types (ordered vs unordered)

From **Prompt 2**: ChatGPT should be able to count items and understand sequence requirements from your list choices

From **Prompt 3**: ChatGPT will suggest additional lists to strengthen your specification

-   Code Blocks - Showing Examples

Updated Feb 12, 2026

[Version history](https://github.com/panaversity/ai-native-software-development/commits/main/apps/learn-app/docs/01-General-Agents-Foundations/02-markdown-writing-instructions/04-code-blocks.md)

# Code Blocks - Showing Examples

When you're writing a specification that says:

> "The program should greet the user and show the current time."

An AI agent could generate code that prints:

-   "Hello"
-   "Hello World"
-   "Hello! Time: 2:30pm"
-   "Greetings, human. Current time: 14:30:00"

Which one do you actually want?

Now imagine you show the exact output in a code block:

```
Hello! The time is 14:30:00
```

Suddenly there's no confusion. The AI knows exactly what format to use.

Code blocks let you show expected output, code examples, and command syntax directly in your specification. This lesson teaches you how to use them effectively.

### Lists vs Code Blocks

In the previous lesson, you learned lists for organizing content. Code blocks serve a different purpose — they preserve exact formatting. Here's the key distinction:

![Side-by-side comparison showing unordered lists (left panel: bullet points using dash syntax for features and independent items) versus fenced code blocks (right panel: triple backticks for showing code examples and command output). Demonstrates when to use each format based on content type.](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-3/chapter-10/lists-vs-code-blocks-distinction.png)

**Lists** format content into readable bullet points or numbered steps. **Code blocks** preserve exact formatting — every space, every character appears exactly as you type it. Use lists when organizing ideas, use code blocks when showing code or expected output.

* * *

## Concept 1: Fenced Code Blocks (Multiple Lines)

Use **fenced code blocks** when you need to show multiple lines of code or output.

### Basic Syntax

Create a fenced code block with **triple backticks** (the `` ` `` key, usually below Escape):

**What you type in your markdown file:**

```
```Line 1 of code or outputLine 2 of code or outputLine 3 of code or output```
```

**What it renders as:**

```
Line 1 of code or outputLine 2 of code or outputLine 3 of code or output
```

Type three backticks, press Enter, type your code, press Enter, then type three more backticks. Everything between displays exactly as you type it (no markdown formatting applied).

Pro-Tip: Documenting Code Blocks

When writing documentation that shows code block syntax (like this lesson), use **quadruple backticks** (\`\`\`\`\`\`) to wrap examples containing triple backticks. This prevents the inner backticks from closing your outer block.

### Example: Showing Expected Output

Here's a specification for a task list app:

**In your README.md:**

```
When the user views tasks, they should see:
```

Then add a code block showing the expected output:

```
Tasks:1. Buy groceries [Pending]2. Call dentist [Complete]3. Submit report [Pending]
```

The AI agent sees this and knows: "The output must show task number, description, and status on each line."

### Example: Showing Program Code

**In your spec:**

```
def add(a, b):    return a + bresult = add(5, 3)print(result)  # Should print: 8
```

This shows the AI: "This is what the code should look like."

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> **Explore with your AI**: "I'm learning about code blocks in markdown. Can you show me what happens when I specify expected output in my specification vs when I don't? Create two versions of a spec for a greeting program—one with a code block showing exact output format, one without. Then explain which would produce more consistent results."

* * *

## Concept 2: Language Tags (For Clarity)

Add a **language tag** right after the opening backticks to specify what type of code it is.

### Syntax

Type three backticks, then the language name (no space), then your code:

**What you type:**

```
```pythonprint("Hello, World!")```
```

**What it renders as:**

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

The word `python` is the language tag. It goes right after the opening triple backticks (no space).

### Common Language Tags

Use these tags based on what you're showing:

-   **`python`** - Python code
-   **`bash`** - Terminal commands
-   **`text`** - Plain output (no code)
-   **`typescript`** - TypeScript code
-   **`json`** - Data formats
-   **`yaml`** - Configuration files

Use the Correct Tag

AI agents are sensitive to language tags. If you tag Python code as `text`, the AI may ignore syntax rules and coding standards (like PEP 8). Always use the correct language tag so the AI generates properly formatted code.

![Two code blocks comparing syntax highlighting: Left block shows code without language tag (plain text, no colors), right block shows Python code with ```python tag (keywords highlighted in color). Demonstrates how adding a language identifier enables syntax highlighting.](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-3/chapter-10/code-block-syntax-highlighting.png)

### Why Language Tags Matter

Language tags help:

1.  **Readers** understand what they're looking at
2.  **AI agents** know what language to generate
3.  **Code viewers** apply correct syntax highlighting

### Example: Installation Commands

**What you type in your README:**

```
```bashpip install requestspython app.py```
```

**What it renders as:**

```
pip install requestspython app.py
```

The `bash` tag tells the AI: "These are terminal commands, not Python code."

### Example: Python Code

**What you type:**

```
```pythondef greet(name):    return f"Hello, {name}!"print(greet("Alice"))```
```

**What it renders as:**

```
def greet(name):    return f"Hello, {name}!"print(greet("Alice"))
```

The `python` tag makes it clear this is Python code to implement.

Expert Insight

Language tags do more than just enable syntax highlighting. They tell AI agents which language interpreter to use, which libraries might be available, and which syntax rules apply. When you tag a block as `python`, the AI knows to generate Python 3.13+ syntax. When you tag it as `bash`, the AI knows these are shell commands. This prevents the AI from mixing syntaxes or generating code for the wrong language—a common error when language context is ambiguous.

* * *

## Concept 3: Inline Code (Single Backticks)

Use **inline code** for short code references within regular text - like variable names, commands, or file names.

### Syntax

Wrap your code reference in single backtick characters:

```
Install the package with `pip install requests` command.The `app.py` file contains the main function.Set the `DEBUG` variable to `True` for testing.
```

**What it renders as:**

Install the package with `pip install requests` command. The `app.py` file contains the main function. Set the `DEBUG` variable to `True` for testing.

### When to Use Inline Code

Use single backticks for:

-   Command names: `python`, `git`, `npm`
-   Variable names: `user_name`, `total_count`
-   File names: `README.md`, `app.py`
-   Function names: `calculate_total()`, `get_user()`
-   Short code snippets within sentences

### Example in a Specification

**In your spec, write:**

1.  Install Python 3.9 or higher
2.  Run `pip install requests` to install dependencies
3.  Create a file named `config.py` with your API key
4.  Run the program with `python weather.py`

**See how it works?**

-   Commands like `pip install requests` are in backticks
-   File names like `config.py` are in backticks
-   Function names like `get_weather()` are in backticks

This makes the specification much clearer.

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Here's a specification without inline code formatting:
> 
> 'Run pip install requests to install dependencies, then edit config.py with your API key, and run python weather.py to start the app.'
> 
> Rewrite this with proper inline code formatting using backticks. Then explain why the formatted version is clearer. What happens if I don't format command names—how does that affect readability?"

* * *

## Fenced vs Inline: Which to Use?

Feature

Syntax

Use Case

**Inline Code**

`` `code` ``

Variable names, file names, short commands in a sentence

**Fenced Block**

` ``` `

Multi-line code, program output, or implementation examples

### Use Fenced Code Blocks (triple backticks) when:

-   Showing multiple lines of code
-   Displaying expected program output
-   Sharing code examples to implement
-   Showing error messages

### Use Inline Code (single backticks) when:

-   Mentioning commands in a sentence
-   Referring to variable or function names
-   Listing file names
-   Writing short code snippets in text

### Side-by-Side Examples

**Fenced block (multiple lines):**

```
def calculate_total(prices):    return sum(prices)items = [10, 20, 30]print(calculate_total(items))
```

**Inline code (within text):**

The `calculate_total()` function takes a list of `prices` and returns the sum. Call it with `calculate_total([10, 20, 30])` to get `60`.

* * *

## Practice Exercise: Task Tracker App (Part 3 - Code Blocks)

**Continuing from Lesson 3**: Open your Task Tracker App specification. You'll now **add code blocks** to show expected output and clarify commands.

### Your Task for Lesson 4

Add code blocks to make your specification more concrete:

**Part 1: Add Expected Output Section**

Fill in the "Expected Output" section with a fenced code block showing what the program displays.

**What you should write in your spec:**

```
## Expected OutputWhen the user runs `python tracker.py`, they should see:```textTask Tracker Menu1. Add Task2. View Tasks3. Mark Complete4. Delete Task5. ExitChoose an option: _```When viewing tasks, the display looks like:```textYour Tasks:1. Buy groceries [Pending] - Due: 2025-11-082. Call dentist [Pending] - Due: 2025-11-073. Submit report [Complete] - Done: 2025-11-06```When the task list is empty:```textYour Tasks:No tasks yet. Use option 1 to add a task.```
```

Pro-Tip: Show Edge Cases

Including edge cases (like empty states) in your code blocks gives the AI a hint to handle these scenarios in the generated code. If you don't show what "empty" looks like, the AI might not handle it gracefully.

**Part 2: Update Installation Commands**

Make sure your installation steps use **inline code** (single backticks) for commands.

**What you type** (notice the backticks around commands):

```
## Installation1. Install Python 3.9 or higher from python.org2. Download the task tracker files from GitHub3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd task-tracker`4. Run the program: `python tracker.py`
```

**What it renders as** (backticks become formatted inline code):

## Installation

1.  Install Python 3.9 or higher from python.org
2.  Download the task tracker files from GitHub
3.  Navigate to the project folder: `cd task-tracker`
4.  Run the program: `python tracker.py`

**Part 3: Add Language Tags**

Ensure your code blocks have the `text` language tag (since this is program output, not Python code).

### Validation Checklist

Check your updated specification:

1.  Expected output section has at least one fenced code block with `text` tag
2.  Code blocks show what the program actually prints (not descriptions)
3.  Installation commands use inline code (`` `cd task-tracker` ``, `` `python tracker.py` ``)
4.  All code blocks have opening AND closing triple backticks
5.  Output is specific (shows actual menu items, not "menu appears")

**Save this file!** You'll add links, images, and emphasis in Lesson 5 to complete it.

* * *

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting Closing Backticks

**Wrong** (missing closing backticks — everything after becomes part of the code block):

```
```pythonprint("Hello")This text becomes part of the code block because there's no closing ```
```

**Correct:**

```
```pythonprint("Hello")```
```

Which renders as:

```
print("Hello")
```

Always close your code blocks with triple backticks.

### Mistake 2: Using Inline Code for Multiple Lines

**Wrong:** The code is `def add(a, b): return a + b` (inline code with multiple lines doesn't work)

**Correct:** The code is:

```
def add(a, b):    return a + b
```

Use fenced blocks for multiple lines.

### Mistake 3: No Language Tag When It Matters

**Unclear (no language tag):**

```
```pip install requests```
```

**Clear (with `bash` tag):**

```
```bashpip install requests```
```

Adding the `bash` tag makes it clear this is a terminal command, not Python code or plain text.

* * *

## Why This Matters for AI

When you use code blocks correctly, AI agents can:

1.  **See exact output format** - "The program prints 3 lines with this structure"
2.  **Understand the language** - "This is Python code, not bash commands"
3.  **Parse code examples** - "This is example code to implement, not expected output"
4.  **Follow command syntax** - "These inline codes are commands to run"
5.  **Semantic anchoring** - When you wrap a command in backticks like `python tracker.py`, you tell the AI: "This is a literal string, not a word to translate or summarize." This prevents the AI from hallucinating different command names.

Good code block usage = clearer specifications = better AI-generated code.

Expert Insight

In professional development, code blocks serve as executable documentation. When you show expected output in a fenced code block, that becomes the acceptance test—did the generated code produce exactly this output? This practice, called "specification by example," reduces ambiguity dramatically. Teams using spec-by-example report 60-80% fewer clarification requests during implementation because everyone (human and AI) can see exactly what "correct" looks like.

* * *

## Try With AI

Validate your Task Tracker App code blocks with AI feedback — and test execution.

### Setup

Use ChatGPT web (or your AI companion from earlier chapters).

### Exercise

Take your **updated Task Tracker App specification** (now with code blocks) and ask ChatGPT:

**Prompt 1 (Structure Check):**

```
I'm learning code blocks in markdown. Can you check if I used the right syntax?[Paste your specification here]Tell me:1. Are my code blocks properly closed?2. Did I use appropriate language tags?3. Should any inline code be fenced blocks instead?
```

**Prompt 2 (Clarity Check):**

```
Based on my specification, can you tell:1. What should the program output look like?2. What programming language is this written in?3. What commands need to be run?
```

**Prompt 3 (Implementation + Execution Test):**

```
Can you implement a simple version of this Task Tracker App specification?Generate Python code that shows the main menu and displays sample taskslike I specified in the Expected Output section.
```

### Expected Outcomes

From **Prompt 1**: ChatGPT confirms your code block syntax is correct

From **Prompt 2**: ChatGPT can parse your specification and understand output format, language, and commands

From **Prompt 3**: ChatGPT generates Python code matching your expected output

# Links and Images

## Connecting Documents to the World

You've learned how to structure documents with headings, organize information with lists, and show code with fenced blocks. Now you'll learn the final elements that make your markdown documents truly useful: **links** to connect to external resources, **images** to show what things look like, and **emphasis** to highlight critical information.

These are the final syntax elements you need for writing effective markdown files like READMEs, CLAUDE.md instructions, and project documentation.

* * *

## Concept 1: Links - Connecting to Resources

A document doesn't exist in isolation. You often need to reference **external documentation**, **examples**, or **standards**. Links solve this problem.

### Why Links Matter

When you write "Use Python's requests library," the reader might not know:

-   What is the requests library?
-   Where do I find it?
-   How do I use it?

But if you write "[Use Python's **requests** library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/)," the reader can click through to complete documentation instantly.

### The Syntax

Markdown links follow a simple pattern:

```
[link text](url)
```

-   **link text** = what the reader sees and clicks
-   **url** = where the link goes

**What you type:**

```
Read the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/) for help.
```

**What it renders as:**

Read the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/) for help.

### Common Mistake: Spaces in URLs Break Links

Beginner mistake:

```
[Wrong link](https://docs.python.org/3/ reference guide)
```

This **won't work** because the space breaks the URL. Either:

1.  Use a URL without spaces (recommended):

```
[Python reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/)
```

2.  Or use URL encoding (replace space with `%20`):

```
[reference guide](https://docs.python.org/3/reference%20guide)
```

For documentation, **always stick with option 1** – find clean URLs without spaces.

### Common Mistake: Vague Link Text

Never use "click here" or "link" as your link text:

**Wrong:**

```
For more information, [click here](https://docs.python.org/).See the [link](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) for details.
```

**Correct:**

```
See the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/) for more information.The [requests library documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) has examples.
```

**Why this matters for AI**: AI agents use link text to understand what the destination provides *without* following the link. `[Python documentation](...)` tells AI it's a language reference. `[click here](...)` provides zero context—AI must guess or follow the link (which it often can't do).

Expert Insight

Links in specifications serve as **context anchors** for AI agents. When you link to library documentation, you're telling the AI: "This is the authoritative source for how this works." Some AI tools can fetch linked URLs to understand APIs better. Even when they can't, the link text provides semantic context—`[requests library](...)` tells the AI you're using the Python requests package, not just making generic "requests."

* * *

## Example 1: Links to Documentation

Here's how to add helpful links to a README:

```
# Weather App## Required Libraries- [Python requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) - for making API calls- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) - free weather data source## Data FormatData should be formatted as JSON. See the [JSON specification](https://www.json.org/) for details.## TestingVerify your app works like the examples in the [OpenWeatherMap docs](https://openweathermap.org/current).
```

Now readers can click through and see:

-   How to use the requests library
-   Where to get weather data
-   What JSON looks like
-   What sample outputs should look like

This **dramatically improves clarity** because you're not just describing, you're pointing to where readers can find more information.

Pro-Tip: Reference-Style Links

For documents with many links, markdown supports reference-style links that keep your text clean:

```
Read the [Python docs][python] and [requests library][requests] documentation.[python]: https://docs.python.org/[requests]: https://requests.readthedocs.io/
```

The link definitions go at the bottom of your document. This is optional but useful for long documents.

## Concept 2: Images - Showing What Things Look Like

Sometimes words aren't enough. You need to **show** what something looks like. That's where images come in.

### Why Images Matter in Documentation

Images help readers understand:

-   **What the UI looks like** - Screenshots show expected interface
-   **How data flows** - Diagrams explain system architecture
-   **Project branding** - Logos make READMEs professional

### The Syntax (Very Similar to Links!)

Markdown images use almost the same syntax as links, with one difference — an exclamation mark `!` at the start:

```
![alt text](image-url)
```

-   **alt text** = description of the image (shown if image doesn't load, read by screen readers)
-   **image-url** = where the image is located (web URL or local file path)

**What you type:**

```
![Python logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png)
```

**What it renders as:**

![Python logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png)

### Where Images Come From

**Option 1: Online images** (easiest for beginners) Use a direct image URL from the web:

```
![Example screenshot](https://example.com/screenshot.png)
```

**Option 2: Local images in your project** Put images in a folder (like `images/` or `assets/`) and reference them with a relative path:

```
![App screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)
```

**For beginners**: Start with online image URLs. Later you can add local images to your projects.

Expert Insight

**Important for AI-native development**: Modern AI models are multimodal—they CAN see images when given visual access. However, when AI reads your markdown files as text (common in coding workflows), it only sees the `![alt text](url)` syntax, not the actual image. Descriptive alt text serves two purposes: (1) accessibility for screen readers, and (2) providing context when AI processes your spec as a text file. Instead of `![screenshot](app.png)`, write `![Task list showing 3 pending items with checkboxes](app.png)`.

* * *

## Example 2: README with Images

Here's how images make READMEs more professional:

```
# Weather Dashboard![Weather Dashboard Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Weather+Dashboard)## Features- **Display** current temperature and conditions- **Show** 7-day forecast- **Save** favorite locations## Architecture![System diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/600x200.png?text=User+→+API+→+Database)
```

See how images make it immediately clear what the app looks like and how it works? That's powerful.

### Common Image Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Forgetting the `!` at the start**

```
[Missing exclamation](image.png)
```

This creates a *link* to the image, not an embedded image. Always use `![...]` for images.

Quick Rule: Link vs Image

-   `[text](url)` = **Take me there** (clickable link)
-   `![text](url)` = **Show it here** (embedded image)

The `!` means "display this content inline" rather than "navigate to this location."

**Mistake 2: Broken image paths**

```
![Screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)
```

If `screenshot.png` doesn't exist at that path, the image won't show. Check your paths!

**Mistake 3: Too many large images**

Don't embed 20 screenshots in one README. Use images strategically:

-   1 logo/banner at the top
-   1-2 key screenshots showing the app
-   Diagrams only when words aren't enough

#### Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "I'm writing a README for a task management app. I want to show what the main interface looks like and a simple architecture diagram. Suggest what images I should include and help me write descriptive alt text for accessibility."

## Concept 3: Text Emphasis - Highlighting What Matters

Sometimes you need to draw attention to specific words or phrases within your text. Markdown provides two levels of emphasis: **bold** for strong emphasis and *italic* for lighter emphasis.

### The Syntax

**Bold** uses double asterisks or double underscores:

**What you type:**

```
This requirement is **critical** for security.This requirement is __critical__ for security.
```

**What it renders as:**

This requirement is **critical** for security.

**Italic** uses single asterisks or single underscores:

**What you type:**

```
See the *optional* configuration section.See the _optional_ configuration section.
```

**What it renders as:**

See the *optional* configuration section.

**Combined** (bold italic) uses triple asterisks:

**What you type:**

```
***Never*** store passwords in plain text.
```

**What it renders as:**

***Never*** store passwords in plain text.

### When to Use Each

Emphasis

Syntax

Use For

**Bold**

`**text**`

Critical requirements, warnings, key terms

*Italic*

`*text*`

Optional items, definitions, slight emphasis

***Both***

`***text***`

Absolute requirements, security warnings

### Example: Emphasis in Specifications

```
## Security Requirements- User passwords **must** be hashed before storage- API keys should *never* be committed to version control- All endpoints **require** authentication- Rate limiting is *recommended* but optional for internal APIs***Critical***: The database connection string contains credentialsand must be stored in environment variables, not in code.
```

Expert Insight

Emphasis helps AI understand priority. When AI sees "**must**" vs "*recommended*", it can distinguish between hard requirements and nice-to-haves. Use bold for requirements that would cause implementation failure if missed, and italic for optional enhancements. This semantic distinction helps AI make appropriate trade-off decisions during implementation.

### Common Emphasis Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Overusing bold**

If everything is bold, nothing stands out. Reserve bold for truly critical items.

**Mistake 2: Inconsistent emphasis for placeholders**

Don't use italic alone to indicate placeholders like *database\_name*. Instead, use inline code with angle brackets: `<database_name>`. This is clearer for both humans and AI.

**Mistake 3: Using emphasis instead of structure**

If you're bolding entire sentences to make them stand out, consider using a heading or callout box instead. Emphasis is for words within sentences, not for creating document structure.

## Try With AI

Test your understanding of links and images by building a real README section.

### Setup

Use ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI companion you have available.

### Prompt 1 (Links Practice):

```
I'm writing a README for a Python weather app that uses the requests libraryand the OpenWeatherMap API. Write me a "Getting Started" section that includeslinks to the relevant documentation. Use proper markdown link syntax.
```

### Prompt 2 (Images Practice):

```
Now add an "Architecture" section to my weather app README. Include a placeholderimage showing the data flow (user → app → API → response). Use proper markdownimage syntax with descriptive alt text.
```

### Prompt 3 (Combined Practice):

```
Review this README section I wrote and suggest improvements to my links and images:## Resources- Python docs: https://docs.python.org- API info at openweathermap.orgScreenshot:[app screenshot](screenshot.png)What markdown syntax errors did I make? Fix them for me.
```

## Practice Exercise: Task Tracker App (Part 4 - Links & Images)

**Continuing from Lesson 4**: Open your Task Tracker App specification. You'll now **add links and images** to complete your first full specification.

### Your Task for Lesson 5

Add links and images to finalize your Task Tracker App specification:

**Part 1: Add Resource Links**

Add a "Resources" or "Documentation" section with helpful links:

```
## Resources- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/) - Language reference- [Python File I/O Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) - For saving tasks to file
```

**Part 2: Add a Placeholder Image (Online URL)**

Add a screenshot placeholder showing what your app's interface looks like:

```
## Screenshot![Task Tracker main menu showing 5 options: Add Task, View Tasks, Mark Complete, Delete Task, and Exit](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png?text=Task+Tracker+Menu)
```

**Part 3: Try a Relative Path (Local Image)**

In AI-native development, AI agents often create images (diagrams, charts) and save them locally. Practice referencing a local image:

1.  Create an `images/` folder in your project
2.  Add any image file (or create an empty placeholder)
3.  Reference it with a relative path:

```
## Architecture Diagram![Data flow diagram showing user input going to Task class then to file storage](./images/architecture.png)
```

This prepares you for when AI generates diagrams and saves them to your project folder.

Pro-Tip: Descriptive Alt Text

Write alt text that describes what the image SHOWS, not just what it IS. "Task Tracker menu" is vague. "Task Tracker main menu showing 5 options" tells the reader (and AI) exactly what to expect.

### Validation Checklist

Check your completed specification:

1.  Has at least one working link to external documentation
2.  Links use proper syntax: `[text](url)` with no spaces in URL
3.  Link text is descriptive (not "click here" or "link")
4.  Has at least one image with descriptive alt text
5.  Image uses proper syntax: `![alt text](url)` with `!` at the start
6.  Alt text describes what the image shows, not just what it is
7.  (Bonus) Includes a relative path image reference like `./images/diagram.png`

* * *

## Why This Matters for AI

When you use links and images correctly in specifications, AI agents can:

1.  **Follow documentation links** - Some AI tools fetch linked pages for additional context
2.  **Understand resource relationships** - Link text tells AI what each resource provides
3.  **Parse alt text for image context** - When reading markdown as text, AI relies on alt text for image understanding
4.  **Generate appropriate placeholders** - When AI creates documentation, it follows your link/image patterns

How AI Processes Images

Modern AI models are multimodal and can view images directly when given visual access. However, in text-based workflows (like reading spec files), AI sees only the alt text and filename. Write descriptive alt text that works for both scenarios—it helps accessibility AND provides context regardless of how your document is processed.

* * *

## Bonus: Additional Markdown Tips

Before we wrap up, here are two important markdown behaviors you should know about.

### Escaping Special Characters

Sometimes you want to display characters like `*`, `#`, or `[` as literal text instead of markdown formatting. Use a backslash `\` to escape them:

![Markdown escape sequences diagram showing how backslash prevents special characters from being interpreted as formatting: *not italic* renders as literal asterisks, # not a header shows the hash symbol, and [link](url) displays bracket syntax instead of creating a link.](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-3/chapter-10/escape-sequences-backslashes.png)

**Common characters to escape:**

-   `\*` → literal asterisk (instead of italic/bold)
-   `\#` → literal hash (instead of heading)
-   `\[` and `\]` → literal brackets (instead of link)
-   `\\` → literal backslash

### How Newlines Work

Markdown handles line breaks differently than you might expect:

![Comparison diagram showing single newline vs double newline behavior: a single Enter key joins lines into one paragraph, while pressing Enter twice (double newline) creates separate paragraphs in the rendered output.](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-3/chapter-10/newline-escaping-markdown-blocks.png)

**Key rule:** A single newline doesn't create a new paragraph. You need a **blank line** (double newline) to separate paragraphs.

```
Line one.Line two.
```

Renders as: "Line one. Line two." (same paragraph)

```
Line one.Line two.
```

Renders as two separate paragraphs.

* * *

## Your First Complete Specification

**Congratulations!** You've now built a complete specification across Lessons 2-5.

Your Task Tracker App specification now has everything an AI agent needs to understand and implement your project:

-   **Clear structure** (headings)
-   **Organized requirements** (lists)
-   **Concrete examples** (code blocks)
-   **Supporting resources** (links)
-   **Visual context** (images)

### What's Next?

In the **Chapter Quiz**, you'll test your markdown knowledge. Then you'll be ready to write specifications for your own projects—and have AI agents help you build them.
